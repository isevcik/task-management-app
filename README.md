# Task Management App built with an Angular frontend and a Node.js backend


## Starting the app
To start the application in local development, please start both the frontend and the backend.
To start a backend:

```bash
cd apps/backend && npm run dev
```

To start a frontend:

```bash
cd apps/frontend && npm run start
```

Once the both are running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.
